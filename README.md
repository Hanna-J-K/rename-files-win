# rename-files-win
very quick unrefined vbs to rename files  

run the file.  
enter the absolute path to the directory with the files you wish to rename (no quotation marks).  
enter string you wish to have replaced (can be an empty string).  
enter new string to replace existing one (can be an empty string, in which case replaced string will be simply removed).  
if the files are numbered (starting from 1) and you wish to remove that, enter the number of the files (not the indexes).  

enjoy.  

ps. be careful as removing file numbers will also remove any other matching numbers from the filename.
